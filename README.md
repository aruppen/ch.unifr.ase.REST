=================

Small Ruby on Rails application showing how to consume RESTful webservices with RoR. Consuming RESTful webservices with RoR is straight forward as long as the service is itself implemented with RoR and follows the RoR guidelines on RESTful webservices. However, quite a few of these webservices are not implemented following ROR RESTful principles. This sample application shows how to consume them by using the ActiveResource::Base class
